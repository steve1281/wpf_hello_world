Hello World WPF 

Probably the simplest example that demonstrates displaying text, reading elements, and updating text.


Key things to remember (for this simple example):

- create the project, select WPF Application C#.  This creates a bunch of code for you. 
- ToolBox should be visible on the left (assuming default layout) whenever you edit an xaml file.
- You can drag and drop UI elements onto you form.  
- You can edit in the XAML source direct, or edit the properties in the panel to the left.
- Double click the element to inject code to handle the click event.



Things you don't need to remember, but might be useful later on:

- you can print to the visual studio debug using *Trace.Writeln("message");* 
- you can tell the project to launch a console, and then use *Console.Writeln ...*
